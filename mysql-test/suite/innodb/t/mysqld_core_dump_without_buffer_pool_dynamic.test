# This test is to test if mysqld can dump a core without large memory buffers.
# We start the server with --innodb-buffer-pool-in-core-file ON, then
# we dynamically set it to OFF.
# Just to play with possible race conditions we switch it to ON and OFF one
# more time.
# Finally we cause core dump to happen.
# See opt file for the config:
#   (1) --innodb-buffer-pool-in-core-file is set to ON initially
#   (2) the buffer pool is set to be 1G so that with the large
#       memory buffers the core size would be much greater than 1GB (the actual
#       core size observed is ~1.8GB) and without them is less then 1GB (the
#       actual observed size is ~700MB)

# madvise MADV_DONTDUMP is non-posix extension available in Linux 3.4
